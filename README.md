Hi there 👋, I am a computational epidemiologist 👨‍💻🦠 and head of the [Interfaculty Platform for Data and Computational Science (INPUT)](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/research/research_groups_and_themes/input/index_eng.html) at the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM)](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch) at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch) 🏫, Switzerland 🇨🇭. I am also a member of the directorate of ISPM.

I use mathematical and computational modeling in combination with data analyses to investigate how the health of populations and the spread of infectious diseases are affected by environmental changes and public health interventions 💊😷💉. I am an expert for emerging infectious diseases and my research has contributed to the better understanding of the transmission dynamics of Ebola, MERS, and COVID-19. I am a member of the [Multidisciplinary Center for Infectious Diseases (MCID)](https://www.mcid.unibe.ch) and the [Bern Data Science Initiative (BeDSI)](https://www.bedsi.unibe.ch) at the University of Bern, and served as a member of the [Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force](https://sciencetaskforce.ch).
